= New Year's in Joshua Tree
:imagesdir: 2022-01-01-jtree-new-years
:figure-caption!:

The new year brought some of the first sunny days after a week of rain.
Wind made Friday and Saturday less than pleasant but those that stayed around for Sunday were rewarded with perfection.
Saturday night was so cold that a gallon of water left out was found frozen solid by morning.

Eleven folks camped including members Alison Annunziata (AM), Ameera Abdelaziz (RM), Brian "BJ" Jennings (RM,G), Laura Karnath (Student), Carl Burdick (Student), Daniel Lee (RM), and myself Rob Donnelly (RM,S1).
A few others made day trips including Farah Alibay (AM) and Justin Barham (RM,S1).
The Fire Fairy aka Steve Cole (RM,S2) made a visit bringing much welcome gifts of firewood.

Rob led the trip.
We had 4 family sites (the offwidth group of sites #3, #4, #6, #7) in Ryan Campground.
A big thank you to Ming Hsieh (RM,G) our Reservations Co-chair for these reservations which need to be made 6 months in advance.
We were over capacity on vehicles Saturday night but got lucky when the folks in site #5 left early.
The backup plan of overflowing into friendly neighbor sites, bathroom parking, or the 3 spots at the camp entrance wasn't necessary.

Rob brought his kids Nora and Loxton for a character-building trip but they ended up being tougher against the cold than he.
The trio spent a lot of time around the fire.
A Mr. Heater Portable Buddy, purchased for the trip, helped take the edge off while transitioning  to and from the sleeping bags.

They started the new year with a trip up to Keys View where gale-force winds threatened to send them into the valley below or at least knock them over.

The trio finished the day by getting everyone to the top of the last route.
Rangers were waiting for them at the base.
The rangers separated everyone and asked how they knew each other.
The trio was mistaken as a guide/client arrangement and guides need a permit to operate in The Park.
The rangers left satisfied that no one was breaking the rules and the trio left with a story to tell.

Dan arrived just in time on Saturday to catch Alison, her boyfriend John, and their three dogs River, Dexter, and Jumar on the way out to Geology Tour Roud to work Equinox (5.12c).

They had type II, bordering on type III, fun battling the excruciating finger jams in near-freezing temps with exceptionally strong winds.

Mary Catherine Eden aka https://www.instagram.com/tradprincess[tradprincess] happened to be in the area, saw their top rope, ran over in her camp slippers, and asked for a belay.
Alison gave the honors as they all watched Mary fly up the route like it was half the grade.

On the other days, Alison got in leads of Frosty Cone (5.7) and Life's a [redacted] and then [rest redacted] (5.7).
On Sunday, Dan went with friends to do Sexy Grandma (5.9), Double Cross (5.7), Toe Jam (5.7), and The Bong (5.4).

Ameera and her friend Joe were the first ones out of camp at 8 am on Saturday before anyone else was brave enough to even exit their car, tent, or bivy in BJ's case.
They got up Dappled Mare (5.8) where the wind made a good climb into an OK climb.

On Friday, they did Mental Physics (5.7) and Let Your Freak Flag Fly (5.7).
They finished out the trip by heading to the warmer elevations of Indian Cove where they did Apparition (5.10a) and some sport climbs on the same formation.
