= A Red Rock April

:figure-caption!:

We had a small but good group at Red Rock this past weekend.
The trip was led by LeRoy Russ (RM/S1) and attended by Jeremy Arca (AM), Don Burton (RM), Nick Lee (AM), and myself, Rob Donnelly (RM/S1).

== The Next Red Rock Trip

But first, a word on the _next_ Red Rock trip.

Sherman Lam and I will be leading the next trip to Red Rock in two weeks on 4/22 to 4/24.
We hope to see more of you out there.

There is something for everyone including families: hiking, mountain biking, even horseback riding, and of course climbing!
There is so much good climbing.
You'll find all combinations of short/long, easy/hard, face/crack, sport/trad, and more!

The drive goes by quickly if you carpool and leave early morning or late evening to avoid traffic.
The spacious group site has several covered tables on a gravel pad.
Civilization is nearby so if you don't feel like cooking you can easily get something to eat in town.

If you have any questions post a comment on the trip page or send us an email.

What are you waiting for?

== The Group

Ok, on to the trip report.

Due to low attendance, LeRoy decided to cancel the site reservation and host us at his place in Summerlin.
We were spoiled with hot showers and soft beds.
LeRoy's garage took the place of the fire pit.
The trip was worth it for the company alone and such stimulating conversation such as the optimal cup shape for lattes.

== Friday

Everyone arrived late afternoon on Friday and got in some climbing before retiring to "camp".
Rob and Nick got in several top rope laps on Atman (5.10a).

Don and Jeremy went to Moderate Mecca where Don led Valentine's Day (5.8+) and Jeremey led Soupy Sales (5.6).

== The Big Day

On Saturday, Don and Jeremy got a 4:30am start for swapping leads on the popular Solar Slab (5.6).
They ended up having the whole route to themselves, a rare occurrence.

They topped out around 1:30pm but didn't make it back to "camp" until after 7pm having opted for the Painted Bowl descent instead of the rappels.
The Painted Bowl, while beautiful, is the source of many sore knees and toes.

== An RM Eval

Nick and Rob got a more leisurely 6:15am start to do Sandy Hole (5.7) on Angel Food Wall for Nick's RM evaluation.
The route was selected based on the unseasonably warm 85 deg F forecast.

If you read the Mountain Project comments, people either love it or hate it.
I loved it but then again I was following.

The route starts with a bang.
The first pitch set the tone.

The second pitch was basically a slot canyon in the middle of the climb.
It started by tunneling into the formation, then went up a chimney, then finished with a chimney traverse out through an eye.
It was one of the more unique pitches I've done.

We then traversed over to the tunnel pitch of Tunnel Vision (5.7) for more shaded climbing.

We topped out just after Don and Jeremy at 1:40pm but made it back to "camp" much much sooner.

Congrats to Nick on a successful RM evaluation!
